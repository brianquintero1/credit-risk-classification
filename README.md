# credit-risk-classification
Module 20 Challenge

The purpose of the analyis is to create a data model that is accurate enough to predict the creditworthiness of potential borrowers at a peer-to-peer lending company. The financial information was provided in a csv file containing 77,536 records and distributed among 8 columns. Please see the main repository to see the README.md file and the final-report_BrianQuintero.md file which contains the report with my findings. Next, within the Credit_Risk folder you will see the credit_risk_classification_BrianQuintero.ipynb file that contains the main code for the machine learning model. Finally inside of the Resources file you will find the original lending_data.csv file which was the source data for analysis.
